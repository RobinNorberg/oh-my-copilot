## Headless smoke against a local build

`omg smoke copilot` loads a plugin root into the real GitHub Copilot CLI inside a throwaway `COPILOT_HOME` and reports one line per check. It replaces the manual "install the plugin and open Copilot" step. Build first: the MCP check spawns `dist/mcp/standalone-server.js`.

```bash
npm run build
omg smoke copilot --tier 0        # free: no model call
omg smoke copilot --tier 1        # costs one premium request
```

### The two tiers

- **Tier 0 is a free load check.** It verifies the manifest and version, the generated hooks and agents, `plugin list` and `skill list` as Copilot sees them, and the MCP server's tool count. Run it after every generator change.
- **Tier 1 adds one live session with the prompt on stdin.** It asserts the session exits cleanly, the session events log parses, our hooks fired, the plugin and MCP server loaded, and the hooks wrote state under `.omg/` in a temp project. Each run is one premium request capped by `--max-credits` (default 30, which is Copilot's minimum).

**Model.** `--model` is optional. Without it Copilot auto-selects a model; 1.0.91 picked `mai-code-1.1-flash`. Explicit ids may be rejected as unavailable for your account, and the `session.exit` detail then says to omit `--model`.

**Auth.** Tier 1 copies only the login identity from your real Copilot config, so a normal `copilot /login` is enough. Do not export a token for it. `GH_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` take precedence over a stored login, and a `gh` token is not entitled to Copilot models, so the smoke drops both from the session when it found a login. `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` is always passed through. Without a stored login, as in CI, all three pass through and one of them must hold a Copilot-entitled token.

**Hooks fail closed.** The session runs with `OMC_HOOK_FAIL_CLOSED=1`, so a crashing hook shows up as a failed `hooks.*` check instead of being swallowed by the hook adapter. The `hooks.adapter_errors` check also fails on any `[omg-hook]` error line in the debug log, session stderr, events, or stdout.

**Sandbox.** The session denies `t(host_smoke)` so the model cannot recurse into the smoke, and passes `--disable-builtin-mcps`. The default prompt also denies `shell` and `write`; `--delegate` keeps them because the hand-off is a tool call. The env drops `OMC_*`, Claude Code host markers, `NODE_OPTIONS`, `COPILOT_MODEL`, `COPILOT_OFFLINE`, and `COPILOT_PROVIDER_*` before spawning Copilot.

Use `--keep-home` to keep the temp homes and project for debugging, and `--json` for the full report. The report's `artifacts.listHome` is the tier 0 home and `artifacts.copilotHome` is the tier 1 session home. `--json` always prints a report; a bad option yields `ok: false` with one `cli.error` check. Exit code `2` means the `copilot` binary was not found and nothing else failed. The binary resolves from PATH first, then `COPILOT_CLI_PATH`, then the WinGet install location on Windows. Set `COPILOT_CLI_PATH` when it is not on PATH; a `copilot` on PATH still wins.

### From vitest

`npm run test:live` runs `tests/live/copilot-smoke.test.ts`. Tier 0 runs whenever the binary resolves and skips otherwise. Tier 1 runs only with `OMC_LIVE_SMOKE=1`, so it never spends a request by accident. The default `npm test` run and CI exclude `tests/live/**`.

### From Claude Code (MCP tool `host_smoke`)

The standalone MCP server exposes the same check as `host_smoke`. Register the local build once:

```bash
claude mcp add omg-dev -- node C:/Code/OMC/dist/mcp/standalone-server.js
```

Then ask Claude Code to call `host_smoke` with `{ "tier": 0 }`. It returns the report JSON and sets `isError` when any check fails. Rebuild after source changes, because the server runs from `dist/`.

The tool is also reachable from inside Copilot through the plugin's own MCP server, so it is fenced. Two env vars on the MCP server lift the fences:

- **`OMC_SMOKE_ALLOW_LIVE=1`** allows `{ "tier": 1 }`. Without it the tool refuses tier 1, because that is a billed session.
- **`OMC_SMOKE_ALLOW_ANY_ROOT=1`** allows a `pluginRoot` other than the package root the server runs from. Paths are compared after resolving symlinks.

```bash
claude mcp add omg-dev -e OMC_SMOKE_ALLOW_LIVE=1 -- node C:/Code/OMC/dist/mcp/standalone-server.js
```

The `omg smoke copilot` CLI has no such gate.

### Copilot CLI facts the smoke relies on

These were verified against Copilot CLI 1.0.91.

- **Free load checks.** `copilot --plugin-dir <root> plugin list --json` and `copilot --plugin-dir <root> skill list --json` make no model call and reflect `--plugin-dir`.
- **A bad `--plugin-dir` only warns.** The command still succeeds and `plugin list` returns `[]`, so assert on the exact entry, never on the exit code.
- **Manifest locations.** Copilot accepts the plugin manifest at `plugin.json`, `.github/plugin/plugin.json`, or `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` under the root.
- **`plugin install` takes no local path.** Use `--plugin-dir` to load a working tree.
- **An isolated `COPILOT_HOME` needs a token.** A fresh home has no stored login, so pass a token through the environment for any model call.
- **Trusted folders are camelCase.** Write `trustedFolders` in `$COPILOT_HOME/config.json` so `-p` runs in the temp project without a trust prompt.
- **No `installed_plugins.json`.** Installed plugins live under `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/`.
