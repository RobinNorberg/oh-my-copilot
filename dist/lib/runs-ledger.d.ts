/**
 * Run ledger (P2 Part A, contract: docs/design/P2-RUN-LEDGER-AND-INTAKE-PLAN.md).
 *
 * Append-only JSONL at `<omcRoot>/state/runs/ledger.jsonl` recording the
 * lifecycle edges of watched unattended modes. Mode state files are wiped by
 * cancel BEFORE the Stop event fires, so a durable trace that survives cancel
 * is the prerequisite for any closeout reconciliation: without this ledger,
 * "did the run write its closeout?" is unanswerable after the fact.
 *
 * Evidence by contract: append failures are swallowed. The ledger is
 * promotion/audit evidence — a broken ledger must never break the state
 * write or clear it observes.
