/**
 * `omg ralph afk "<task>" [--verify "<command>"]...` — launch a headless,
 * narrowly-permissioned ralph session and return to the prompt.
 *
 * Reuses the factory chain's AFK link profile (scoped allowlist +
 * project,local settings) and its argv builder, so a ralph run spawned here
 * obeys the same isolation contract as a chain link: no user-level hooks or
 * settings, no general Bash — only the gh/file/WebFetch surface, the
 * read-only git commands ralph's own stale-state detection needs, and
 * exactly the declared `--verify` commands.
 *
 * Two consequences of that isolation shape the launch:
 * - A session with `--setting-sources project,local` cannot see
 *   plugin-bundled skills, so a `/oh-my-copilot:ralph` prompt degrades
 *   into a plain one-shot request. The ralph skill is materialized as a
 *   PROJECT skill before launch (the chain-ring contract) and invoked as
 *   `/ralph`.
 * - The mandatory deslop pass (Step 7.5) invokes the plugin-bundled
 *   `ai-slop-cleaner` skill, which such a session equally cannot see — the
 *   pass could never complete and the loop would stall. The launch
 *   therefore injects `--no-deslop`; HITL ralph runs keep the pass.
 *
 * On a Copilot host the launch spawns `copilot` with the Copilot translation
 * of the AFK profile (`--allow-tool` / `--allow-url` rules, see
 * COPILOT_AFK_SPAWN_FLAGS) and materializes the skill under `.copilot/skills`.

 * The session's own feedback gate must be runnable inside the session: the

 * `--json` all pass.
 *
 * Deliberately no OMC MCP entries: a live probe of an isolated session
 * (`--setting-sources project,local`) showed the bridge MCP server does not
 * register there at all — trace_summary / state_write / state_read simply do
 * not exist, so allowlist entries for them would be cargo-cult. Consequence,
 * documented in the skill's budget rule: the token-budget stop is
 * attended-only; headless cost control is task sizing.
