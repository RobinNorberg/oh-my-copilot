/**
 * Factory command (spec: OMC 软件工厂闭环, tracker issue #9).

 * `omg factorylisten` — the resident intake daemon. Transport adapters
 * (smee.io / cloudflared / direct) live outside the OMC boundary: the daemon
 * only receives already-unpacked webhook events as POSTs and does the OMC-side
 * work itself (HMAC verification, repo whitelist, intake label gate, routing
 * through the shared pure function, headless intent session spawn).
 *
 * `omg factoryinit` — seeds the project route table (`.omg/factory-routes.json`,
 * the single source of truth the SessionEnd chain enqueuer reads) and validates
 * the factory prerequisites. Default seeds the narrow starter loop; --no-narrow
 * seeds the full-pipeline widening template. Never overwrites without --force.
 *
 * Liveness: pid file at <omc root>/state/factory-listener.json (SessionStart
 * supervision reads it) plus a GET /status endpoint on the listening port.
