 * stdin on Windows: cmd.exe's ANSI codepage mangles non-ASCII argv (dogfood:
 * Chinese intent prompts and issue bodies mojibake'd), while the stdin pipe
 * stays UTF-8 end to end. It also keeps free text away from cmd.exe, whose
 * quote parity disagrees with CRT argv parsing (`\"` splits argv) and which
 * expands %VAR% inside quotes. The remaining fixed argv is quoted by
 * quoteForCmd (CRT-correct, rejects `%` and CR/LF).
 *
 * The .cmd-shim constraint is a Windows PLATFORM fact, not a shell fact: gate
 * on process.platform, never on shell detection. Gating on the shell made
 * Git Bash (MSYSTEM set) skip the cmd.exe route and spawn the .cmd shim
 * directly, which CreateProcess cannot exec — the child died instantly and
 * silently (stdio ignored), so `omg ralph afk` under Git Bash launched
 * nothing. Factory chain links escaped this only by accident: the detached
 * worker's env is an allowlist that drops MSYSTEM. The long-running factory
 * listener (src/factory/listener.ts), which spawns links from its own
 * inherited environment, had the same broken route under Git Bash.
 *
 * detached:true is win32-hostile here (dogfood bisect: cmd.exe children
 * spawned detached exit 1 before writing a transcript), so it is only
 * applied off-win32. Orphaning still holds: Windows children survive
 * parent exit without the detached flag.
