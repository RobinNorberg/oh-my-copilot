/**
 * SessionEnd chain enqueuer (spec #9 tracker issue #17).
 *
 * The SessionEnd hook cannot see the session prompt, so chain membership
 * rides a ledger file (`.omg/state/factory/chain-<sessionId>.json`) written
 * by whoever spawned the session (listener / executeSpawnNext). At session
 * end we map the hook reason to a chain outcome, route through the T1 pure
 * seam, grade a declared gate if the ledger carries one, run the guardrails,
 * and enqueue the chain into the spawn-next action payload. Everything here
 * is cheap sync fs — the actual spawn stays in the detached worker.
