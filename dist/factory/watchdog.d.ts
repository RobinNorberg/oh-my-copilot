/**
 * Factory chain watchdog (T4): detects and flags stalled chain links.
 *
 * A ledger without a routeTable is a pre-written first-ring ledger that no
 * enqueuer has taken over yet (the listener writes `{intentId, stage}`;
 * `executeSpawnNext` writes the routeTable-carrying ledger for later links).
 * If such a ledger ages past the threshold, its session never made it to a
 * SessionEnd handoff — stalled. The enqueuer never rewrites or deletes the
 * ledger on consumption, so ledgers whose session already has an 'enqueued'
 * decision in chain-decisions.jsonl are treated as advanced, not stalled.
 *
 * Pure detection + one-shot flagging; scheduling the sweep is the caller's
 * job (event-driven integration, no timers in this module).
